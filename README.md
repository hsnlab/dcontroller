# Declarative Kubernetes controller runtime

This is a preliminary implementation for the declarative Kubernetes controller runtime. The main
goal is to reduce the mental overhead of writing Kubernetes controllers, by providing simple
automations to eliminate some of the repetitive code that must be written when coding against the
upstream [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) project. The
final goal is to let anyone with minimal Go skills to write NoCode or LowCode style.

The main tools here are *declarative Kubernetes API translation* and *incremental
reconciliation*. Declarative Kubernetes API translation allows to view the Kubernetes API as a
NoSQL database and run simple declarative queries on it. This can be done by registering an
aggregation pipeline (inspired by [MongoDB
aggregators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) to map the Kubernetes
API resources to a *view* of interest to the controller. These views are dynamically maintained by
the declarative controller runtime, by running the aggregation pipeline on the watch events
automatically installed for the base Kubernetes API resources on top of which the view is defined
on. Incremental reconciliation then means that the controller can watch the incremental changes to
the views, instead of the raw ("materialized") views, which simplifies writing [level-triggered
conrollers](https://hackernoon.com/level-triggering-and-reconciliation-in-kubernetes-1f17fe30333d).

<!-- The Kubernetes controller-runtime Project is a set of go libraries for building -->
<!-- Controllers. It is leveraged by [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) and -->
<!-- [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). Both are -->
<!-- a great place to start for new projects. See -->
<!-- [Kubebuilder's Quick Start](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html) to -->
<!-- see how it can be used. -->

<!-- # Versioning, Maintenance, and Compatibility -->

<!-- The full documentation can be found at [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md), but TL;DR: -->

<!-- Users: -->

<!-- - We follow [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://semver.org) -->
<!-- - Use releases with your dependency management to ensure that you get compatible code -->
<!-- - The main branch contains all the latest code, some of which may break compatibility (so "normal" `go get` is not recommended) -->

<!-- Contributors: -->

<!-- - All code PR must be labeled with :bug: (patch fixes), :sparkles: (backwards-compatible features), or :warning: (breaking changes) -->
<!-- - Breaking changes will find their way into the next major release, other changes will go into an semi-immediate patch or minor release -->
<!-- - For a quick PR template suggesting the right information, use one of these PR templates: -->
<!--   * [Breaking Changes/Features](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/breaking_change.md) -->
<!--   * [Backwards-Compatible Features](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/compat_feature.md) -->
<!--   * [Bug fixes](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bug_fix.md) -->
